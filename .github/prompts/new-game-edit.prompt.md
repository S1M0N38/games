Create a game following the [game guidelines](../game-guidelines-instructions.md) 
Do not create games similar to the ones in [manifest.json](../../games/manifest.json).

### Example Game Template

Here is an example template for a game folder:

- [game.js](../../games/_example/game.js)
- [index.html](../../games/_example/index.html)
- [style.css](../../games/_example/style.css)
- [game.json](../../games/_example/game.json)

If you want to use code from _example template, you must copy the files to your game folder and modify them as needed.

It's **really** important to follow the steps described in the [development process](../development-process-instructions.md).

Remember to follow the development process in order:
1. Brainstorm about game ideas (**idea generation**).
2. Write the **game design document** in the `README.md`.
3. Implement the game (**development**).
