Create a game following the [game guidelines](../game-guidelines-instructions.md) 
Do not create games similar to the ones in [manifest.json](../../games/manifest.json).

### Templates

Here is an example template for a game folder structure is as follows:

- [game.js](../../games/_example/game.js)
- [index.html](../../games/_example/index.html)
- [style.css](../../games/_example/style.css)
- [game.json](../../games/_example/game.json)

Here are some examples for `game.json` for get the inspiration for the SVG:

- [orbit-dodge](../../games/orbit-dodge/game.json)
- [reaction-dots](../../games/reaction-dots/game.json)
- [gravity-field](../../games/gravity-field/game.json)

It's **really** important to follow the steps described in the [development process](../development-process-instructions.md).
Start with the **idea generation**, then write the **game design document** in the `README.md`, and then implement the game.
