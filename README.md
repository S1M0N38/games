This is an experiment to test the current capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating simple games.

All games in the collection are created by prompting the AI to generate a new game following a set of rules (see [Game Guidelines](.github/game-guidelines-instructions.md) and [Development Process](.github/development-process-instructions.md)).
