# Reaction Dots Game Design Document

## Game Title
Reaction Dots

## Genre
Arcade / Reaction

## Target Audience
Casual gamers of all ages who enjoy quick, reflex-based games.

## Game Description
Reaction Dots is a simple yet challenging game that tests players' reaction time. The game presents a grid of dots that randomly change to a target color. Players must click on dots as quickly as possible when they change to the target color to score points. The game increases in difficulty as players score higher, with dots remaining in the target color for shorter periods of time.

## Core Gameplay Mechanic
- Dots appear on screen in a neutral color
- Dots randomly change to the target color for a brief period
- Player must click dots when they're in the target color to score points
- Missing a target dot or clicking a non-target dot reduces lives
- Game ends when the player runs out of lives

## Visual Style and Design
- Minimalist design with high contrast colors
- Simple circular dots arranged in a grid
- Visual feedback for successful and failed clicks
- Clean UI showing score and lives

## Controls and User Input
- Mouse click: Click on dots when they turn to the target color
- Spacebar: Restart the game after game over

## Win/Loss Conditions
- **Loss Condition**: Game ends when the player runs out of lives
- **Win Condition**: No definitive win condition; the goal is to achieve the highest possible score

## Technical Implementation
- DOM-based implementation using HTML elements for dots
- CSS transitions for smooth color changes
- JavaScript for game logic and state management
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes

## Known Limitations
- Desktop-focused gameplay (requires precise clicking)
- No difficulty settings
- No persistence for high scores

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Add high score tracking with localStorage
- Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Add sound effects for feedback
- Add touch support for mobile devices
