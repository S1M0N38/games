# Space Dodger - Game Design Document

## Game Overview
Space Dodger is a minimalist arcade game where players control a small spacecraft navigating through an endless field of incoming asteroids. The game focuses on precision movement and spatial awareness, creating an engaging and meditative gameplay experience in a stark black and white aesthetic.

## Core Mechanic
The game revolves around a single core mechanic: **mouse-based avoidance**. Players control a white triangular spacecraft that follows mouse movements within the game area. The goal is to dodge incoming asteroids (represented by white geometric shapes) that descend from the top of the screen at varying speeds and trajectories. The game has no end state - it continues indefinitely, with the challenge progressively increasing as the player survives longer.

## Technical Approach
- **Rendering**: Canvas-based for smooth animations
- **Input**: Mouse-only control scheme
- **Animation**: Smooth ease-in-out transitions for all movements
- **Scoring**: Simple stopwatch display that counts milliseconds survived

## Visual Design
- **Color Palette**: Strict black (#000000) background with white (#FFFFFF) game elements and subtle grayscale accents
- **Player Ship**: Minimalist white triangle
- **Asteroids**: Varied white geometric shapes (circles, polygons) with different rotation patterns
- **Feedback**: No text UI, only visual feedback through animations
- **Screen Layout**: Full-screen canvas with minimal visual indicators for game state
- **Score Display**: Stopwatch-style display that shows elapsed time in milliseconds

## Animation Plan
- **Player Movement**: Smooth following of mouse with slight lag for natural feel
- **Asteroid Movement**: Each asteroid has unique rotation and subtle wobble patterns
- **Game Start**: Simple fade-in animation for the player ship

## Audio Approach
- Minimal, pleasing audio feedback for:
  - Near misses (soft whoosh sound)
  - Collisions (subtle impact sound)
  - Background ambiance (very low, ambient tone)

## Technical Implementation Details
1. **Game Loop**: Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60FPS gameplay
2. **Collision Detection**: Shape-based collision detection for different asteroid types
3. **State Management**: Minimal states (playing, transitioning, error)
4. **Performance Optimization**: Object pooling for asteroid management

## Error Handling
If a critical JavaScript error occurs, a full-screen red error overlay with trembling border will appear, conforming to the error state visual specification.

## Local Storage Usage
Minimal data storage for:
- Recording if the game has been played before
- Storing the player's longest survival time (without displaying explicit numbers)
