# Breakout Blocks - Game Design Document

## Title, Genre, and Target Audience
**Title:** Breakout Blocks  
**Genre:** Minimal Arcade Game  
**Target Audience:** Desktop users seeking a classic brick-breaking challenge with simple mechanics

## Gameplay Description
Breakout Blocks focuses on a single core mechanic: controlling a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The player moves a horizontal paddle at the bottom of the screen using keyboard controls (left and right arrow keys). A ball bounces around the screen, and the player must prevent it from falling off the bottom edge.

The angle of the ball's bounce depends on where it hits the paddle, allowing for strategic aiming. Each brick broken adds to the player's score. The player starts with three lives and loses one each time the ball falls below the paddle. The game ends when all lives are depleted or all bricks are cleared.

## Visual Style
- **Color Palette:** Strictly black (`#000000`) background with white (`#FFFFFF`) and grayscale elements. Red (`#FF0000`) appears only for error feedback.
- **Graphics Approach:** All visual elements are created through code using simple geometric shapes (rectangles for bricks and paddle, circle for ball).
- **UI Elements:**
  - Score counter: Top-right corner (numerical display only)
  - Lives indicator: Top-left corner (represented by white dots/circles)
  - Help button ("?"): Bottom-right corner
- **Help Panel:** Toggles on "?" button click, containing minimal text explaining the goal and controls

## Controls
- **Input Mode:** Keyboard-only
- **Interactions:**
  - Left Arrow Key: Move paddle left
  - Right Arrow Key: Move paddle right
  - ESC key: Pause/resume gameplay
  - Q key: Exit to landing page

## Technical Approach
- **Rendering Method:** Canvas-based implementation for efficient collision detection
- **Animation Techniques:**
  - requestAnimationFrame for smooth game loop
  - Ease-in-out transitions for all animations
  - Subtle glow effects for active elements
- **State Management:** Game state tracking:
  - Playing, paused, game over states
  - Score
  - Lives remaining
  - Ball and paddle positions
- **Data Persistence:** Local storage for high score only

## Visual Feedback Guidelines
- **Ball Animation:**
  - White circle with subtle glow effect
  - Impact animations when hitting bricks
- **Brick Destruction:**
  - Brick flashes and fades out when hit
  - Different grayscale shades for brick rows (darker at bottom, lighter at top)
- **Life Loss:** Visual feedback through life indicator reduction
- **Game Over:** Fade overlay with restart option
- **Error Handling:** Red full-screen overlay with warning icon (no text) and trembling border if a critical error occurs
